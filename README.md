## Quickstart

Initialize AppAmbit early in your application lifecycle (e.g. in `MauiProgram.cs`.

```csharp
using AppAmbit;

public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseAppAmbit("YOUR-APPKEY");

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

---

## Usage

* **Session activity** – automatically tracks user session starts, stops, and durations
* **Ambit Trail** – records detailed navigation of user and system actions leading up to an issue for easier debugging
* **Track events** – send structured events with custom properties

  ```csharp
      Analytics.TrackEvent("Audio started", new Dictionary<string, string> {
        { "Category", "Music" },
        { "FileName", "favorite.mp3"}
    });
  ```
* **Logs**: add structured log messages for debugging

  ```csharp
    Crashes.LogError("This code should not be reached");
  ```
* **Crash Reporting**: uncaught crashes are automatically captured and uploaded on next launch

---

## Release Distribution

Upload your APK, AAB, or IPA directly to your AppAmbit dashboard.
Distribute release builds through:
* Direct install links
* Email distribution
* Environment-specific channels

---

## Privacy and Data

* The SDK batches and transmits data efficiently
* You control what is sent — avoid secrets or sensitive PII
* Complies with store policies for iOS and Android.

For more details, see **[docs.appambit.com](https://docs.appambit.com)**.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **No data in dashboard** → verify API key, check network access, and ensure `AppAmbitSdk.Start()` is called once at startup.
* **NuGet restore issues** → run `dotnet restore` or clear local caches with `dotnet nuget locals all --clear`.
* **Crashes not appearing** → remember crashes are reported on the next app launch.
